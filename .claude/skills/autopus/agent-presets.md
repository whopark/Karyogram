# Agent Presets Skill

## Overview

Agent presets define which agents are active for a given project type. Presets allow teams to activate only the agents relevant to their domain, skipping phases that reference inactive agents and reducing unnecessary overhead.

## Preset Definitions

### `backend-go`

Optimized for Go backend services.

**Active agents**: executor, tester, planner, reviewer, validator, security-auditor, annotator, perf-engineer

### `fullstack`

Includes all backend-go agents plus frontend support.

**Active agents**: executor, tester, planner, reviewer, validator, security-auditor, annotator, perf-engineer, frontend-specialist

### `cli-tool`

Minimal set for CLI tools and utilities.

**Active agents**: executor, tester, planner, reviewer, validator, annotator

## Preset Table

| Preset | Agents | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `backend-go` | executor, tester, planner, reviewer, validator, security-auditor, annotator, perf-engineer | Go microservices, APIs |
| `fullstack` | All backend-go + frontend-specialist | Web apps with Go backend + JS/TS frontend |
| `cli-tool` | executor, tester, planner, reviewer, validator, annotator | CLI utilities, scripts, SDK tools |

## Configuration (`autopus.yaml`)

Set a preset for the project:

```yaml
agent_preset: backend-go  # or fullstack, cli-tool
```

## Default Behavior

If `agent_preset` is **not set**, ALL agents are active. This is backward compatible with existing configurations that do not specify a preset.

## Custom Presets

Define project-specific presets in `autopus.yaml`:

```yaml
agent_presets:
  custom:
    agents:
      - executor
      - tester
      - planner
      - reviewer
      - validator
```

Then activate with:

```yaml
agent_preset: custom
```

Custom presets extend the built-in list. Any agent name not recognized is ignored with a warning.

## Pipeline Behavior

When a preset is active, phases referencing inactive agents are **skipped**:

| Phase | Skipped When |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 2.5 (Annotation) | `annotator` not in preset |
| Phase 3.5 (UX Verify) | `frontend-specialist` not in preset |
| Security audit step | `security-auditor` not in preset |
| Performance check | `perf-engineer` not in preset |

Skipped phases are logged:

```
[SKIP] Phase 2.5 (Annotation): annotator not in preset cli-tool
[SKIP] Phase 3.5 (UX Verify): frontend-specialist not in preset cli-tool
```

Gate phases (Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3) are never skipped — they run with whichever agents are available in the preset.
