# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Quick Start

```bash
playwright-cli open                         # open new browser
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev  # navigate
playwright-cli snapshot                     # get element refs
playwright-cli click e15                    # interact with ref
playwright-cli type "search query"          # type text
playwright-cli screenshot                   # capture screenshot

## playwright-cli vs agent-browser

| 기능 | playwright-cli | agent-browser |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Ref 형식 | `e1`, `e2` | `@e1`, `@e2` |
| Snapshot | YAML 형식 | 접근성 트리 |
| Session | 명시적 세션 관리 (`-s=`) | 자동 세션 유지 |
| DevTools | tracing, video, console, network | HAR, network route |
| 브라우저 선택 | chrome/firefox/webkit/msedge | Chrome only |
| State 관리 | state-save/load (auth.json) | cookies set/get |
| 강점 | 테스트 생성, 멀티 브라우저, DevTools | AI 최적화 JSON 출력, Rust 성능 |

둘 다 사용 가능. 테스트 생성/멀티 브라우저는 playwright-cli, AI 에이전트 직접 조작은 agent-browser 권장.
