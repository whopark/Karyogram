# Agent Teams Skill

## Overview

Agent Teams mode (`--team`) enables role-based team collaboration via Claude Code Agent Teams. Instead of spawning ephemeral subagents per task, this mode creates persistent teammates that communicate directly, share a task list, and self-coordinate through the pipeline.

**Activation flag**: `/auto go SPEC-ID --team`

## Activation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Value | How to verify |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Claude Code version | v2.1.32 or later | `claude --version` |
| Environment variable | `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` | `echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` |
| Feature status | **Experimental** — disabled by default | Official: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams |

### Environment Setup

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

The Autopus harness injects this variable via `.claude/settings.json` automatically.

### Failure Modes

If the variable is not set OR Claude Code is below v2.1.32, the pipeline MUST error with:

```
Error: Agent Teams mode unavailable
  Claude Code version: {detected} (required: v2.1.32+)
  CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS: {set|not set}
Fallback: Run without --team to use the subagent pipeline mode.
```

## Team Constraints (Official)

Agent Teams enforces these rules at the Claude Code layer — violating them fails at runtime:

| Constraint | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Nested teams | Teammates MUST NOT call `TeamCreate` — only the top-level session can create a team |
| Cleanup authority | Only the Lead (team creator) may delete the team; teammates request cleanup via `SendMessage` |
| Recommended size | **3–5 teammates** per team (official guidance). Autopus default (Lead + 1–2 Builders + Guardian) fits this range |
| Persistence | Team config persists in `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`; task list in `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/` |

## Team Roles

### Lead (1 agent)

**Responsibilities**: planner + reviewer

- Joins the team as a teammate — the **top-level session** creates the team and spawns Lead via `TeamCreate` + `Agent(..., team_name=..., name="lead")`. Lead MUST NOT call `TeamCreate` itself (Claude Code rejects nested team creation at runtime).
- Runs Phase 1 (Planning) to produce the execution plan
- Coordinates tasks with Builder(s) and Guardian via `SendMessage`
- Monitors task list and consolidates results
- Runs Phase 4 (Review) and finalizes output
- Re-assigns or requests fallback from the top-level session if a teammate fails

### Builder (1–2 agents)

**Responsibilities**: executor + tester + annotator + frontend-specialist

- Implements code following TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Writes tests in Phase 1.5 (Test Scaffold) before implementation
- Executes Phase 2 (Implementation) in an isolated worktree
- Applies `@AX` annotation tags in Phase 2.5 (Annotation)
- Communicates validation requests to Guardian via `SendMessage`
- Reports completion to Lead via `SendMessage`

### Guardian (1 agent)

**Responsibilities**: validator + security-auditor + perf-engineer

- Executes Gate 2 (Validation): coverage, lint, race conditions
- Performs security audit on modified files
- Monitors performance regressions
- Responds to partial validation requests from Builder
- Reports validation results to Lead via `SendMessage`

## Team Creation Pattern

All team lifecycle operations (create, spawn, delete) are owned by the **top-level session** — the Claude Code main session that receives the user's `/auto go --team` invocation. Teammates MUST NOT call `TeamCreate`; this is enforced by Claude Code at runtime.

### Prerequisite — Load deferred tool schemas

`TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, and `TeamDelete` are deferred tools. Load their schemas once before first use:

```
ToolSearch(query="select:TeamCreate,SendMessage,TeamDelete")
```

### Spawn sequence (top-level session only)

```python
TEAM_NAME = f"team-{spec_id.lower()}"         # e.g., "team-auth-001"

# Step 1: Top-level session creates the team.
# Side effect: the main session is AUTOMATICALLY registered as a member with
# name="team-lead" and agentType=<agent_type>. Do NOT spawn a separate lead Agent().
TeamCreate(
    team_name   = TEAM_NAME,                  # NOTE: parameter is team_name, NOT name
    description = "<SPEC title>",
    agent_type  = "planner",
)

# Step 2: Top-level session spawns the 3 non-lead teammates in a SINGLE message
# (Agent() calls must be emitted together to spawn in parallel)
Agent(subagent_type="executor",  team_name=TEAM_NAME, name="builder-1", isolation="worktree")
Agent(subagent_type="tester",    team_name=TEAM_NAME, name="tester")
Agent(subagent_type="validator", team_name=TEAM_NAME, name="guardian")
```

Each teammate loads its agent definition from `.claude/agents/autopus/` and inherits its frontmatter (tools, model, skills, permissionMode). The `name` field becomes the addressable handle for `SendMessage({to: "<name>"})`. The main session is addressable as `team-lead`.

### Verification gate

After spawn, the top-level session MUST verify all 4 core members are registered (team-lead + 3 teammates):

```bash
jq '.members | length' ~/.claude/teams/{TEAM_NAME}/config.json
# expected: 4 (team-lead + builder-1 + tester + guardian)
jq -r '.members[].name' ~/.claude/teams/{TEAM_NAME}/config.json
# expected lines: team-lead, builder-1, tester, guardian
```

If `.members | length < 4`, the team is **not** viable for multi-agent collaboration. Abort Route B and fall back to Route A (subagent pipeline).

### Teardown

WHEN the pipeline terminates (success, abort, or circuit break), shut down teammates per-teammate (broadcast `to:"*"` accepts plain text only, not structured shutdown messages), then call `TeamDelete()`:

```python
for name in ("builder-1", "tester", "guardian"):
    SendMessage(to=name, message={"type": "shutdown_request", "reason": "pipeline complete"})

# After teammates respond and exit (typically <10s)
TeamDelete()     # fails if any active teammate remains
```

Task assignment via `SendMessage`:

```python
# Lead → Builder
SendMessage(to="builder", message={
    "phase": "Phase 2",
    "tasks": [...],
    "worktree": "<path>"
})

# Lead → Guardian
SendMessage(to="guardian", message={
    "phase": "Gate 2",
    "target_branch": "<branch>",
    "coverage_threshold": 85
})
```

## Execution Flow

```
Lead: Phase 1 (Planning)
  → Assigns tasks to Builder(s) and Guardian

Builder: Phase 1.5 (Test Scaffold)
  → Writes failing tests first (RED)

Builder: Phase 2 (Implementation)
  → GREEN phase in isolated worktree
  → Merge back after completion

Builder: Phase 2.5 (Annotation)
  → Applies @AX tags to modified files

Guardian: Gate 2 (Validation)
  → go test -race ./...
  → Coverage check (85%+)
  → golangci-lint run
  → Security audit

Lead: Phase 4 (Review)
  → Consolidates all results
  → Final quality check
  → Produces review report
```

## Builder-Guardian Direct Communication (P1-R3)

Builder can request partial validation from Guardian without waiting for Lead coordination:

```python
# Builder → Guardian (partial validation request)
SendMessage(to="guardian", message={
    "type": "partial_validation",
    "files": ["pkg/foo/bar.go"],
    "reason": "security-sensitive change"
})

# Guardian → Builder (validation result)
SendMessage(to="builder", message={
    "type": "validation_result",
    "status": "PASS",  # or FAIL
    "issues": []
})
```

All direct interactions are logged in the pipeline log:

```
[P1-R3] builder → guardian: partial_validation request (pkg/foo/bar.go)
[P1-R3] guardian → builder: PASS
```

## Subagent Fallback Strategy

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` not set | Error + fallback guidance to use subagent pipeline |
| Builder teammate fails mid-task | Lead re-assigns task to another Builder or spawns a subagent |
| Guardian teammate fails | Lead falls back to subagent validator with `Agent(subagent_type="validator")` |
| Team creation fails | Abort and fall back to default subagent pipeline |

## Worktree Isolation

The same worktree isolation rules (R1–R5 from `worktree-isolation.md`) apply in Agent Teams mode:

- Each Builder teammate works in an independent git worktree
- Maximum 5 simultaneous worktrees
- GC suppression: `git -c gc.auto=0 <command>` required during parallel execution
- Exponential backoff on shared resource lock contention (3s → 6s → 12s)
- Failed worktrees cleaned up with `git worktree remove --force <path>`
