# SPEC Review Gate Skill

A review gate that validates SPEC document quality using multiple providers.
Before Step 1, treat `content/rules/spec-quality.md` as the pre-review self-check that spec-writer should already have applied to `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `acceptance.md`, and `research.md`.

## Review Process

### Step 0: spec-writer self-verify

Confirm that the draft went through a first-pass self-check using `content/rules/spec-quality.md`.
Look for observable traces such as `research.md`'s `## Self-Verify Summary` or `spec.md`'s `## Open Issues`.
Also prefer the draft's `## Outcome Lock`, `## Completion Debt`, `## Evolution Ideas`, `## Reviewer Brief`, `## Traceability Matrix`, and `## Reference Discipline` as scope-control evidence: review listed blockers and invariants first, treat Completion Debt as blocking, and treat Evolution Ideas or unrelated deeper-layer suggestions as advisory unless they expose critical/security/data integrity risk.
Do not create or request follow-up/sibling SPECs from Evolution Ideas. A sibling SPEC request is valid only when the draft includes a `## Sibling SPEC Decision` with an allowed reason and bounded ownership.
If the checklist was skipped or obviously not reflected in the draft, call that out as a completeness or style finding before continuing.

### Step 1: Load SPEC

Load `.autopus/specs/SPEC-{ID}/spec.md` and extract requirements.

### Step 2: Collect Code Context

If `spec.review_gate.auto_collect_context: true`:
- Scan project source files
- Collect relevant code within `context_max_lines` limit
- Include collected code in the review prompt

### Step 3: Multi-Provider Review

Run the review via the Orchestra engine with configured providers (claude, gemini, etc.):
- Each provider reviews the SPEC independently
- Results are merged according to the strategy (debate, consensus, etc.)

### Step 4: Verdict

Parse results and determine the final verdict:
- **PASS**: SPEC approved, update status to "approved"
- **REVISE**: Revision required, return with list of findings
- **REJECT**: Fundamental redesign required

### Step 5: Save Results

Save `review.md` to the SPEC directory:
- Final verdict
- Findings from each provider
- Original responses

## CLI Usage

```bash
auto spec review SPEC-PIPE-001
auto spec review SPEC-AUTH-001 --strategy debate --timeout 180
```

## Configuration (autopus.yaml)

```yaml
spec:
  review_gate:
    enabled: true
    strategy: debate
    providers: [claude, gemini]
    judge: claude
    max_revisions: 2
    auto_collect_context: true
    context_max_lines: 500
```

## Provider Fallback

If a configured provider binary is not installed:
- Skip that provider and output a warning
- Continue review with available providers only
- Return an error if no providers are available
